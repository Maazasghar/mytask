            It is a <u>long established fact</u> that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page<br>
             when looking<bdo dir="ltr"> left to right</bdo> at its layout. The point of using <b>Lorem Ipsum </b>is that it has a more-or-less normal<br>
              distribution of letters,, as opposed to using<i> 'Content here, content here',</i> making it look like <br>
              readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as<br>
               their <strong> model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'</strong> will uncover many web sites still in <br>
               their infancy.<em>Various versions have evolved</em> over the years, sometimes by accident,<br>
             sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of <small> the printing and typesetting industry</small>. Lorem Ipsum has been<br> the
             industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took <br>a galley of type
              and scrambled<ins> it to make a type</ins> specimen book<br>. It has survived<mark> not only five centuries</mark>, but also the
               leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br> It was popularised in the 1960s 
               with the release of Letraset sheets containing<sub> Lorem<br> Ipsum passages</sub>, and more <br>recently with desktop
                publishing<sup>software like Aldus PageMaker </sup> versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            “BUT now I let the aching splendour go,
I dare not call the crownèd angels peers,
Henceforth! I am content to dwell below,
’Mid common joys, with humble smiles and tears,
Delighted in the sun and breeze to grow,
A child of human hopes and human fears.”
WATHEN MARK WILKS CALL.

“LEBEN ist jedoch des Lebens höchstes Ziel
Und immer ist die arme Kunst gezwungen
Zu bettlen von des Lebens Ueberfluss.”
